    "### Creating Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"maroon\" size=\"6\"><b>1.</b></font> **Leverage Ratio (Dependent Variable)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To construct our outcome variable, we first imported firm-level financial data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` Python library.  \n",
    "For each firm, `yfinance.Ticker()` provides access to three key quarterly statements:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Income Statement** → `ticker.quarterly_financials`  \n",
    "- **Balance Sheet** → `ticker.quarterly_balance_sheet`  \n",
    "- **Cash Flow Statement** → `ticker.quarterly_cashflow`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each statement was transposed so that **rows represent reporting periods** and **columns represent financial items**.  \n",
    "We then selected the most recent quarter with the most complete data (in this case, 2024-09-30 for Apple) and isolated the balance sheet for variable construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the balance sheet, we extracted two key variables:  \n",
    "- `Total Debt`  \n",
    "- `Total Assets`  \n",
    "\n",
    "These are used to calculate the firm’s leverage ratio as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Leverage Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, this computation is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total_debt   = balance_yahoo[\"Total Debt\"]\n",
    "total_assets = balance_yahoo[\"Total Assets\"]\n",
    "leverage     = total_debt / total_assets\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"maroon\" size=\"6\"><b>2.</b></font> **Return on Assets (ROA)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we construct our first explanatory variable, **Return on Assets (ROA)**, which measures a firm's profitability relative to its total assets.  \n",
    "This variable captures how efficiently a firm uses its asset base to generate net income.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each firm, we use two data sources from the quarterly financial statements obtained via the `yfinance` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Net Income** → located in the **Income Statement** (`ticker.quarterly_financials`)\n",
    "- **Total Assets** → located in the **Balance Sheet** (`ticker.quarterly_balance_sheet`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both statements were transposed to align reporting periods, and we selected the same quarter used for the dependent variable (the most recent complete period).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROA is then calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n",

    "net_income   = income_yahoo[\"Net Income\"]\n",
    "total_assets = balance_yahoo[\"Total Assets\"]\n",

    "```\n",
    "<font color=\"maroon\" size=\"6\"><b>3.</b></font> **Asset Tangibility (PPE / Total Assets)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our next explanatory variable measures the **tangibility of assets**, which captures the proportion of a firm's total assets that are physical and can be used as collateral.  \n",
    "In capital structure theory, firms with more tangible assets generally have greater access to debt financing, since these assets can serve as security for lenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each firm, both components of this ratio are taken from the **Balance Sheet** obtained via the `yfinance` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Net Property, Plant, and Equipment (Net PPE)** → from `ticker.quarterly_balance_sheet`  \n",
    "- **Total Assets** → from `ticker.quarterly_balance_sheet`\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous variables, statements were transposed to align reporting periods, and we selected the same quarter used for the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tangibility ratio is then calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Tangibility} = \\frac{\\text{Net PPE}}{\\text{Total Assets}}\n",

    "Our next explanatory variable captures **firm size**, a key determinant of financial structure.  \n",
    "Larger firms generally have more diversified operations, lower default risk, and better access to credit markets, which can influence their leverage decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure firm size, we use **Total Assets** from the **Balance Sheet** (`ticker.quarterly_balance_sheet`) and apply a **natural logarithmic transformation**.  \n",
    "Because total assets vary by several orders of magnitude across firms, taking the logarithm reduces scale differences, mitigates heteroskedasticity, and linearizes the relationship between firm size and leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Firm Size} = \\ln(\\text{Total Assets})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, this computation is expressed as:\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color=\"maroon\" size=\"6\"><b>5.</b></font> **Market-to-Book Ratio (M/B)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next the **Market-to-Book Ratio (M/B)**, captures how investors value a firm relative to its accounting (book) value.  \n",
    "A higher M/B ratio indicates that the market expects greater growth potential or intangible value not reflected on the balance sheet, while a lower ratio suggests the market values the firm closer to its tangible assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute this variable, we combine data from both **market prices** and **balance sheet fundamentals** obtained from the `yfinance` library. Specifically, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Book Equity (Common Stock Equity)** → from the **Balance Sheet** (`ticker.quarterly_balance_sheet`)  \n",
    "- **Shares Outstanding** → from the **Balance Sheet** (`ticker.quarterly_balance_sheet`)  \n",
    "- **Stock Price** → daily closing price on the quarter-end date, obtained using `ticker.history()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Market Value of Equity (Market Capitalization)** is calculated as the product of the share price and shares outstanding.  \n",
    "We then divide this market value by book equity to obtain the Market-to-Book ratio.  \n",
    "Finally, a log is applied to reduce skewness and make the variable more normally distributed for regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Market-to-Book} = \\frac{\\text{Price} \\times \\text{Shares Outstanding}}{\\text{Book Equity}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then\n",
    "$$\n",

    "<font color=\"maroon\" size=\"6\"><b>6.</b></font> **Effective Tax Rate (ETR)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Effective Tax Rate (ETR)** measures the percentage of a firm’s pre-tax income that is paid in taxes.  \n",
    "It provides insight into how taxation affects a company’s net profitability and can vary due to tax credits, foreign income, or deferred tax adjustments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, the effective tax rate is obtained directly from the firm’s **Income Statement** using the `yfinance` variable `'Tax Rate For Calcs'`, which is Yahoo Finance’s standardized measure of the effective tax rate.  \n",
    "This variable reflects the company’s average tax burden as reported in its quarterly financials.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the effective tax rate is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ETR} = \\frac{\\text{Tax Expense}}{\\text{Income Before Tax}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since Yahoo Finance provides a pre-calculated value (`'Tax Rate For Calcs'`), we use that field directly in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "effective_tax_rate = income_yahoo[\"Tax Rate For Calcs\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "<font color=\"maroon\" size=\"6\"><b>7.</b></font> **Stock Price Volatility (Realized Volatility)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Realized Volatility** variable captures fluctuations in a firm’s stock price over the quarter and serves as a proxy for **market uncertainty** or **risk perception**.  \n",
    "In capital structure theory, firms with higher volatility face greater financial uncertainty and are less likely to use high levels of debt, while firms with stable prices may take on more leverage due to their lower perceived risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure this, we use daily closing prices from **Yahoo Finance** within the same reporting quarter (in this case, July 1 to September 30, 2024).  \n",
    "We first compute the **daily returns** by looking at closing prices between days of the period, then take their **standard deviation** to obtain the realized volatility for the quarter.  \n",
    "This value reflects the average daily percentage change in the firm’s stock price.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The formulas are:\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Turnover Ratio** measures how frequently a firm’s shares change hands in the market and serves as a proxy for **liquidity** and **investor activity**.  \n",
    "A higher turnover ratio indicates that a larger proportion of the company’s outstanding shares are being traded on an average day, reflecting **greater liquidity**, **market attention**, and **ease of trading**.  \n",
    "Conversely, a lower turnover ratio may signal **less liquidity**, **higher insider ownership**, or a **smaller free float** (fewer shares available to trade).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Turnover connects to capital structure decisions through **market liquidity and information asymmetry**.  \n",
    "Firms with highly liquid stocks (high turnover) generally face lower transaction costs and easier access to external financing, while firms with illiquid stocks (low turnover) may face higher costs of capital and rely more on internal funding.  \n",
